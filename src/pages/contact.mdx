# Contact Me

You can get in touch with me by opening the nearest window and yelling out of it really loud, or smoke signals could work too. Maybe a Bat-Signal?

## Or you can just wave at me

Just click the button down here to simulate a friendly wave 👇🏾

Disclaimer: Please note I may not wave back since I am very far away and might be busy eating tacos 🌮🌮🌮.
