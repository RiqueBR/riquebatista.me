So here it is, my first post. Been delaying this day for so long and thinking back now I'm not even sure why. The idea of this site was to have a place where I could express my thoughts, not necessarily about tech as much but anything that I find it interesting. I love the concept of a digital garden and that's the goal, to bring all of my thoughts and ideas into a centralised place. So let's call it here for now, and I'm looking forward to writing more.

Tchau
